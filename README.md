# guzzle-config-operations-bundle
This bundle allows Symfony projects to add Guzzle operations to their configuration

## Installation
`composer require pierrerolland/guzzle-config-operations-bundle`

And in your app/AppKernel.php
```php
class AppKernel extends Kernel
{
    public function registerBundles()
    {
        $bundles = [
            // ...
            new JMS\SerializerBundle\JMSSerializerBundle(),
            new Guzzle\ConfigOperationsBundle\GuzzleConfigOperationsBundle()
        ];

        return $bundles;
    }
```

## Usage

### 1. Define your client

```á»³aml
# services.yml

services:
  app.client.foo:
    class: GuzzleHttp\Client
    tags:
      - { name: guzzle.client, alias: foo }
```
The tag line is important, and requires both the `name: guzzle.client` and `alias` parts.

### 2. Define your client's configuration, including the operations

```yaml
# guzzle.yml

guzzle_config_operations:
  clients:
    foo:
      baseUrl: "http://foo"
      operations:
        readBar:
          httpMethod: "GET"
          uri: "/bar/{barId}"
          responseClass: AppBundle\Model\Bar
          parameters:
            barId:
              type: "string"
              location: "uri"
              required: true
        # other operations here
```

The operations documentation can be found here for example http://guzzle3.readthedocs.org/webservice-client/guzzle-service-descriptions.html

### 3. Use the client

A new service will appear, called guzzle_client.[the alias you used]. You can call the operations directly.

```php
   // @var AppBundle\Model\Bar $bar
   $bar = $this->get('guzzle_client.foo')->readBar(['barId' => 1]);
```

The bundle is still in development, for example it needs some exceptions handling. If you're motivated, don't hesitate to PR :)
